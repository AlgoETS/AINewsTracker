# Explanation

## Project Goals

The main objective of AINewsTracker is to leverage AI and machine learning to analyze, understand, and deliver the latest news in the financial sector. Using sophisticated NLP (Natural Language Processing) algorithms, it processes raw news data from multiple sources, extracts relevant information, and provides it in a structured format that's easy to consume and understand.

In the current implementation, the project aims to:

- Aggregate financial news from multiple sources in real time
- Extract insights using NLP and machine learning techniques
- Provide a RESTful API that serves the latest news and insights
- Deliver this information in a user-friendly and intuitive interface

The project focuses on stock market news but it's designed to be flexible. The techniques applied can easily be adjusted to cover other areas in the financial sector like commodities, forex, cryptocurrency and more.

## Future Directions

As we continue to develop and refine AINewsTracker, we have set a few goals for the future direction of the project:

1. **Expand data sources**: We aim to integrate more news sources to provide a more comprehensive view of the financial market.

2. **Improve NLP capabilities**: We plan to incorporate more advanced NLP techniques to improve the accuracy and depth of our insights.

3. **Personalized experience**: We're looking into offering user profiles that would allow for personalized news feeds based on user's interests and portfolio.

4. **Real-time alerts**: Implementing a system to alert users in real-time about major market changes or news regarding their personal portfolio.

5. **Market predictions**: Combining the power of financial news with other market indicators to provide market trend predictions.
