# Example

In AINewsTracker, we manage various types of data including news sources, articles, comments, and company information. Here's a simplified outline of how these various data types might interact:

```plaintext
# Example of a News Source
news = {
    'source_name': 'The AI Journal',
    'topics': ['AI', 'ML'],
    'country': 'US',
    'language': 'EN',
    'type': 'Online',
    'source_url': 'https://theaijournal.com',
    'link': 'https://theaijournal.com/latest-news',
    'last_update': '2023-06-24',
}

# Example of an Article linked to a News Source
article = {
    'title': 'Latest AI Advancements',
    'url': 'https://theaijournal.com/latest-ai-advancements',
    'publishedDate': '2023-06-24',
    'text': 'This article discusses the latest advancements in AI...',
    'source_name': news['source_name'],
    'sentiment': 'Positive',
    'author': 'John Doe',
    'company': 'Google Inc.',
}

# Example of a Comment linked to an Article
comment = {
    'content': 'Great article!',
    'date': '2023-06-24',
    'article_id': article['url'],
}

# Example of a Company linked to an Article
company = {
    'symbol': 'GOOG',
    'name': 'Google Inc.',
    'sector': 'Technology',
}
```

In this simplified example:

- A `news` dictionary represents a news source.
- An `article` dictionary represents an article, which is linked to the `news` source from which it originated. It's also linked to a `company` through the company's name.
- A `comment` dictionary represents a comment made on the article. It is linked to the `article` through the article's URL.
- A `company` dictionary represents a company. It is linked to the `article` through the article's company name field.

These dictionaries demonstrate how different data types could be structured and linked within AINewsTracker.

Please note: This is a simplified example for illustrative purposes. Actual data structures might be more complex and contain more fields. For detailed data structure definitions, please refer to the respective Pydantic model classes (`News`, `Article`, `Comment`, `Company`) in the codebase.


# NLP Sentiment Analysis for an Article
article_sentiment_analysis = {
    'title': article['title'],
    'url': article['url'],
    'sentiment_score': 0.8,  # The sentiment score of the article text. Positive numbers indicate positive sentiment, negative numbers indicate negative sentiment, and zero indicates neutral sentiment.
    'sentiment': 'Positive',  # The sentiment of the article, determined based on the sentiment score.
}

# Example of NLP Ticker Detection for an Article
article_ticker_detection = {
    'title': article['title'],
    'url': article['url'],
    'tickers': ['GOOG'],  # The ticker symbols found in the article text.
}
